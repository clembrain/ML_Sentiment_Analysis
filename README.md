### ABSTRACT  
The goal of this job is to get a thorough grasp of large data systems through the exploration of particular subjects that highlight the interaction between theory and real-world applications. It entails employing well-liked big data tools and methodologies in addition to having competence with common data analysis tasks including loading, cleaning, analyzing, and producing reports. It is essential to be proficient with Python, SQL, or Linux terminal commands in order to pass this test.

### INTRODUCTION  
In my capacity as an AI engineer and data scientist given the opportunity to investigate more about clinical trials, I’ve carefully examined the dataset that is given me. Several important topics are intended to be addressed by this investigation, which skillfully uses visuals to bolster findings.  

First, I’ll look at the total number of studies in the dataset, making sure to explicitly account for different research. The types of research that are here will next be discussed, with each type listed with its corresponding frequency in order of least to most frequent. I’ll also include the top 5 conditions found in the dataset along with their corresponding frequencies.  

I’ll also look for sponsors, paying special attention to non-pharmaceutical businesses. I’ll count the number of clinical studies that the top 10 sponsors outside the pharmaceutical industry have supported. Etc.

# 🍲 ML Sentiment Analysis — Culinary Insights from User Reviews

## 👩‍💻 Project Summary
This project explores how **sentiment analysis** and **text mining** can extract actionable insights from user feedback on recipes. By analyzing review texts and associated star ratings, we uncover patterns in user satisfaction that can guide recipe enhancements, customer engagement strategies, and data-driven culinary decisions.

---

## 🧠 Objectives
- Use **natural language processing (NLP)** to analyze user-generated content.
- Understand how star ratings correlate with written feedback.
- Identify key positive and negative terms influencing recipe perception.
- Build machine learning models to predict sentiment based on review text.
- Provide business recommendations based on data insights.

---

## 📁 Dataset
- **Source**: [Kaggle - Recipe Reviews and Feedback](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joebeachcapital/recipe-reviews-and-user-feedback-dataset)
- Includes:
  - Recipe names
  - User reviews
  - Star ratings
  - Metadata

---

## 🧪 Methods and Techniques

### 1. Data Preparation
- Cleaned missing and duplicate records
- Renamed columns for clarity
- Tokenization, Lemmatization, Stopword Removal

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis
- Summary statistics
- Most and least reviewed recipes
- Distribution of star ratings

### 3. Sentiment Analysis
- **VADER** for compound, positive, neutral, and negative scores
- Visualized review polarity across recipes
- Identified sentiment-heavy recipes

### 4. Machine Learning Modeling
- Feature Extraction via CountVectorizer
- Addressed class imbalance using **SMOTE**
- Trained **Multinomial Naive Bayes** classifier
- Evaluated with Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score

---

## 📊 Visualizations
- Count plots of star ratings
- Word clouds for positive and negative reviews
- Top frequent terms in each sentiment category
- Recipe-level sentiment breakdowns

---

## 📌 Key Findings
- Majority of reviews express **positive sentiment** (compound median ≈ 0.78)
- Recipes with high negative feedback often contain specific recurring issues
- Most frequent negative terms: *bland, undercooked, soggy*
- Most frequent positive terms: *delicious, easy, perfect*

---

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries
- Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn, NLTK (VADER), WordCloud
- SMOTE for balancing class distribution

---

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repo
2. Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`
3. Run the notebook/script to analyze the data
4. View results and plots in output cells
